            <h2>The delicieus Yaourt </h3>
            <p>Ready to make your own yogurt at home?! It couldn’t be simpler. There are great reasons to make your own yogurt–it’s economical, and also: so much more flavorful than commercial yogurts. No special equipment is necessary such as a yogurt maker or slow cooker. Your own pot works perfectly.</p>

        <h2>Ingredient</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Milk</li>
            <li>The Starter</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>In a large, heavy-bottom pot, bring the milk just to a boil (or 210 degrees F) OVER MEDIUM-LOW HEAT. The low heat takes longer to get to a boil, but this low-and-slow method helps prevent the milk from burning on the bottom of the pan. Milk burns easily! If your milk is room temperature rather than cold straight from the refrigerator, the heat time will be much shorter.</li>
            <li>Once the milk foams up to a boil, remove it from the heat immediately. Take care here! Milk will boil over quickly once it reaches the boiling point. Stand by, and as you see the milk rise, pull the pot off the heat. Now allow the milk to cool down to 110-115 degrees F. Use a thermometer or the pinkie test like Sitto taught me: when you can just barely run your pinkie through the milk to the count of ten without pulling it out from the heat, you’re there.</li>
            <li>Add the starter. I like to temper the starter by spooning a little of the warmed milk into it just before adding it to the pot. Just give the pot of milk with the starter a quick stir, cover the pot with the lid, and place in a warm spot to rest and incubate for 8 hours. Jiggle the pot to see if the yogurt has solidified at this point. If yes, you’ve done it! You’ve made yogurt! If the yogurt is still liquid, put the lid on the pot and allow it to incubate for another 4-8 hours.</li>
        </ol>
